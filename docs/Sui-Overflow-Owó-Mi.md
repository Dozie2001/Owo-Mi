## PROJECT JOURNEY
Dozie was interested in participating in the Solana Renaissance Hackathon that concluded a month ago. He put together a team of friends and coursemates, namely Joba, Draco, and Ola, to work on a product for the hackathon. Apart from Draco and Dozie, it was our first time working on a project related to cryptocurrency or web3.

After coming up with the idea for Owó Mi, we started researching its possibilities and how the app would come together. We realized we needed a designer for the app's appearance. Ola recommended Dami, a friend he had previously worked with. Shortly after, Dami joined the team. At that time, we hadn’t built anything solid yet, as Draco, our blockchain expert with web3 experience, took on the role of writing the smart contract to power our app.

Draco encountered some difficulties while writing the smart contract, which extended the development time. Joba started working on the mobile interface using Dami’s designs. The rest of the work, which was backend development, was left to Dozie and Ola. We made a costly mistake by choosing FastAPI to handle requests to the mobile app. By the time Draco finished and pushed the smart contract, we were still figuring out which packages to use and encountered various errors. There was no good support for interacting with our smart contract on Solana with Python. By then, it was too late as the submission date was around the corner. We abandoned our progress and decided to port Owó Mi to the Sui Overflow Hackathon.

When Dozie mentioned Sui to the team, Draco's face lit up as he was very familiar with the blockchain, calling Sui "his baby." We decided to change our backend technology to TypeScript, as that is Sui's SDK language. Draco rewrote the smart contract in Sui's Move. Joba implemented zkLogin authentication in the mobile application, simplifying user account creation by associating it with popular OpenID credentials like Google or Facebook.

## FINAL PUSH
After weeks of intense development, our progress was delayed by university exams, which set us back for two to three weeks. Despite this, we were determined to finish the project on time. With only a few weeks left before the submission deadline, we knew we had to work even harder.

During this time, we dedicated many late nights to the project. We held several discussions and meetups, both online and in person, to solve every challenge that came our way. Our team worked tirelessly, constantly improving our approach and fixing problems as they came up.

The pressure was high, but our commitment to making Owó Mi a reality kept us going. We balanced our school responsibilities with our passion for this project, making sacrifices and prioritizing our work. Each team member gave their best, contributing their unique skills and knowledge.

Finally, after overcoming many obstacles and working through countless sleepless nights, we are proud to say that we have finished our project. The journey was tough, but our shared dedication and hard work have paid off. We are excited to present Owó Mi and look forward to what lies ahead.

## FINAL THOUGHTS
It has been a long journey, filled with good experiences shared between five university friends. I would do this a thousand times with you guys again and again. Hopefully, all our efforts do not go in vain, and maybe, just maybe, we win something big. But the experience is worth more. Thank you, guys.

Yours Truly,
